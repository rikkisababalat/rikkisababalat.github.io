<p>Once upon a time, there was a man who wandered through life, constantly searching for something more. He felt lost, always reaching for fleeting desires, like grasping at puffs of smoke. But deep inside, he knew there was a profound truth he needed to hold onto.</p>
<p>He realized that eternity must be his home, moment by moment. It was the key to finding meaning and purpose. Determined to glimpse this truth, he embarked on a journey of self-discovery.</p>
<p>He understood that his life should be an ongoing process of embracing his truest self, at the deepest and most easeful levels of his being. Everything else in his life became secondary - his job, his children, his wife, his wealth, his creations, and his pleasures. They were superficial and empty unless they were immersed in the deep sea of his conscious loving.</p>
<p>Throughout his day, he observed how often his attention wandered into the realm of constant change - events, people, thoughts, and experiences. He realized that his attention needed to relax into its source, into that which made it conscious and aware.</p>
<p>With practice, he learned to feel the constant, silent tone behind and within the music of life. This unchanging presence became his source, always available and ever-present. He delved into this source, allowing his attention to subside effortlessly, even if just for a moment.</p>
<p>From this deep connection, he began to approach his work, his relationships, his family, and his creative endeavors. He discovered that when he engaged with life from this source, everything transformed. Even the act of making money became an expression of his true self.</p>
<p>To support his journey, he sought aids that would help him relax into this source and create from it. He read books that reminded him of his true nature, spent time with inspiring people who reflected the source to him, and practiced daily rituals of meditation, contemplation, or prayer.</p>
<p>He knew that most men were caught in the habit of focusing on daily events and tasks, letting life slip through their fingers. But he didn't want to fall into that trap. He understood that every responsibility, every task, could be lived as an expression of his depth of being and heart-truth.</p>
<p>He was determined to know eternity, whatever it took. He realized that postponing the process of connecting with his source for the sake of mundane business would only lead to a life consumed by empty hours and days. He wanted to be grounded in something larger than life itself so that he could play with a sense of humor, knowing that every task was a mere mirage of necessity.</p>
<p>Even in the most trivial moments, like watching TV or cleaning up a mess in the kitchen, he felt the truth of who he was. He experienced boundless cognizance in each instant, where clarity, completeness, and humor merged. Every moment held the same intensity when he met it with his deepest realization. Nothing that had ever happened made any difference to the essence of his being.</p>
<p>And so, he continued his journey, always holding onto his deepest realization, navigating life with a profound sense of purpose and joy, knowing that eternity resided within him, moment by moment.</p></div>
